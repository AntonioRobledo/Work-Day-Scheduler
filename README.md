# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This simple scheduler application was designed for someone with a standard 9-5 day job who wishes to keep track of what tasks they have at every hour of the day. In any of the hour blocks, the user can type in what tasks they have in that hour and click the save icon located to the right of the description box. This feature was implemented with the idea that a user would be able tohave their tasks saved to the webpage if it were ever to be closed. In addition to this, the application has a built-in feature that will display one of three different colors: grey indicates that a time block has already passed, the red indicates the current hour that the user is viewing during that time, while a green time block indicates events to come in the future.
